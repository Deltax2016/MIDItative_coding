# Meditative coding

## This project uses a fast Fourier transform to determine the musical note. 

### How to use fft_notes:

0. Make sure your microphone is in working order
1. Run fft_notes.py
2. Wait "start ..." message
3. Play note from ur piano, guitar etc.
4. Program returns the musical note

### How to use fft_multiple_notes:

0. Make sure your microphone is in working order
1. Run fft_multiple_notes.py
2. Play note from ur piano, guitar etc.
3. Program returns the musical note every second
4. Program returns all notes when finished

### TODO:

- [ ] Delete all noise, to make program less sensitive
- [ ] Create interface
- [ ] Maybe instrument detection
- [ ] Rewrite FFT function
